# Assignment 5: Secure Socket Communication

## Goal

The primary goal of this assignment is to learn how to establish a secure (SSL) connection to a web server using Python's `socket` and `ssl` modules. The script connects to `www.google.com`, sends a standard HTTP GET request, and saves the resulting HTML content to a file.

This demonstrates the fundamental process of secure communication over the web, which is the basis for HTTPS.

## How to Run the Script

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Python 3.x

2.  **Execution**:
    Navigate to the `a5` directory in your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python secureget.py
    ```

    Upon successful execution, the script will:
    * Connect to `www.google.com` on port 443.
    * Send an HTTP GET request.
    * Create a file named `response.html` in the current directory containing the HTML source of the Google homepage.

## Files in This Directory

* `secureget.py`: The main Python script that performs the secure socket connection and request. It is written in a modular format for clarity and reusability.
* `response.html`: The HTML output file generated by `secureget.py` after successfully fetching the content from the server.
